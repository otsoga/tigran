# Tigran

## Introduction
Tigran is an chess program under development and written in C.

## Building and running
`docker build -t tigran`
`docker run -it chess-game`

## Roadmap

The development of Tigran is guided by a series of progressive milestones aimed at enhancing its capabilities and user experience. Below is an overview of the key features and improvements I'm planning:

- ASCII chess board [x]
- Text input for moves [x]
- Legal move and checkmate recognition [ ]
    - Move the pieces [x]
- Random play of legal moves by CPU [ ]
- Better play of legal moves by CPU (methodology to be expanded upon later) [ ]
